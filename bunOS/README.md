# Ideas

- gnu+linux OS aimed at Windows users
- Terminal locked by password
(so that if there is a need for the terminal
it can be accessed, but by default people are assumed not to use it)
- No tty
- Lightweight wm (for instance IceWM) with Windows and Mac themes
- Easy to read manual
(not xman : ugly, and can't search inside)
(not man -H because browsers are far from lightweight)
- Easy to use security apps
(example : enigmail on thunderbird ; qtpass)
- Using big repos (Debian, or Arch for instance)
